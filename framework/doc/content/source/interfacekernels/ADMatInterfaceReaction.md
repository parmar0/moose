# ADMatInterfaceReaction

## Description

Specie M transports between two domains (domain 1 and domain 2), at the interface consider the following reaction is taking place:

\begin{equation}
M(1)\xrightleftharpoons[k_b]{k_f}M(2)
\end{equation}

With the first order reaction rate assuming a quasi-steady-state

\begin{equation}
\textrm{Reaction Rate} = \frac {\partial C_1} {\partial t} = k_f C_1 - k_b C_2 \approx 0
\end{equation}

where $C_1$ is the specie concentration in domain 1, $C_2$ is the specie concentration in domain 2, $k_f$ is the forward reaction coefficient, and $k_b$ is the backward reaction coefficient. `ADMatInterfaceReaction` object is used to impose this condition.

[`InterfaceDiffusion`](/InterfaceKernels/index.md) is also used in this case to control flux at  the interface. However, the flux is not well-defined at boundaries. To address this issue, InterfaceReaction kernel applies a condition to constrain the discontinuity across the interface.

Both kernels at the interface work together to give full mathematical and physical meaning of the problem.
